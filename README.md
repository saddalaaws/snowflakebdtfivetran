# Snowflake Sales Analytics Data Transformation Pipeline use Case

## Overview
This project implements a data transformation pipeline for sales analytics. The goal is to consolidate and transform sales data from multiple sources into a unified format suitable for analysis. The pipeline utilizes dbt (data build tool) for data transformation and FiveTran for data extraction and loading.

## Objectives
1. **Data Transformation Techniques**: Clean and prepare the raw sales data by removing duplicates and normalizing date formats.
2. **Installing dbt**: Set up dbt and configure a simple project.
3. **Version Control with GitHub**: Use GitHub for version control to manage the dbt project.
4. **Building Sample Models in dbt**: Create a basic dbt model to transform the raw sales data.
5. **Monitoring Alerts**: Implement basic monitoring and alerting mechanisms.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps to Install dbt
1. Install dbt using pip:
bash
pip install dbt-core
2. Create a new dbt project:
bash
dbt init sales_analytics_pipeline
3. Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd sales_analytics_pipeline
4. Configure the `dbt_project.yml` file to set up your project settings.

## Version Control with GitHub
1. Initialize a Git repository:
bash
git init
2. Add project files to the repository:
bash
git add .
3. Commit the initial project setup:
bash
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
4. Push to GitHub:
bash
git remote add origin <your_github_repo_url>
git push -u origin main
## Building Sample Models in dbt
1. Write a dbt model to transform the raw sales data into a structured format in the `models/` directory.

2. Run the dbt model:
bash
dbt run
3. Validate the results to ensure the transformation was successful.

## Monitoring Alerts
- Set up basic email notifications for pipeline failures using the FiveTran dashboard.

## Deliverables
1. A fully functional data transformation pipeline that consolidates and cleans sales data from multiple sources.
2. A dbt project with well-documented models and configurations.
3. A GitHub repository with version-controlled dbt project files.
4. A FiveTran setup with automated data extraction and loading.
5. A monitoring and alerting system to track the status of data pipelines.

## Submission
- Submit the GitHub repository link containing the dbt project.
- Provide access to the FiveTran dashboard and monitoring alerts.
- Include a report detailing the implementation process, challenges faced, and how they were resolved.
